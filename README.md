# Chrome extension new tab

Open the `about:blank` page when you open a new tab.

## Why

The [new tab redirect](https://github.com/jimschubert/NewTab-Redirect) does this well for years, util Chrome 61 released.

So, if you updated your chrome to v61+, and you want to open a blank page immediately after you open the new tab. This is a best choice.

## How

1. Download the source code;
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Check `Developer mode`
4. Click `Load Unpacked Extension...`
5. Select the `new-tab` source code directory from step 1
6. Uncheck `Developer mode`
